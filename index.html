          Mixteca Organization, serving Sunset Park’s Latinx community, has been doing census and COVID-19 outreach in four different Indigenous Mesoamerican languages: Tu’u Savi, Ki’iche, Nahuatl, and Mixe, which are all spoken in
          Sunset Park.
          In-person census outreach was derailed by the COVID-19 shutdown. Mixteca held events almost every day in Sept. to make up for lost time. At these events Indigenous speakers were present to engage with the portion of Sunset Park’s Mexican
          immigrant community that is not comfortable with Spanish. As of 2018, New York State Assembly District 51, which includes Sunset Park, was almost 25% immigrants of Central American origin according to data from Social Explorer. Dr. Daniel
          Kaufman, the founder of the Endangered
          Language Alliance, said that recently “the major sending zone from Mexico for immigrants to New York expanded from Puebla into Guerrero. Guerrero is really one of the most neglected rural states in Mexico. And the majority, especially from
          the sending region,
          are Indigenous and speakers of an Indigenous language.”
